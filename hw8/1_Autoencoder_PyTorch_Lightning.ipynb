The `classifier` has a static task as it will output our predictions given a one-dimensional input. The `encoder`'s task is to extract meaningful information out of our input so that the classifier can make a proper decision. Right now however, both networks will be consisting of linear layers coupled with auxiliary ones and therefore won't be too different in their design. This split-up will be relevant later, e.g., by using convolutional layers which are introduced in the lecture. We are going to set up the `encoder` now. \n","\n","Think about a good network architecture. You're completely free here and can come up with any network you like!

This is particularly easy using `nn.Sequential()` which you only have to pass the list of your layers. \n","\n","To make your model customizable and support parameter search, don't use hardcoded hyperparameters - instead, pass them as dictionary `hparams` (here, `n_hidden` is the number of neurons in the hidden layer) when initializing `models`.\n","\n","Here's an simple example:\n","\n","```python\n","        self.model = nn.Sequential(\n","            nn.Linear(input_size, self.hparams[\"n_hidden\"]),\n","            nn.ReLU(),            \n","            nn.Linear(self.hparams[\"n_hidden\"], num_classes)\n","        )\n","```\n","\n","Have a look at the forward path in `forward(self, x)`, which is so easy that you don't need to implement it yourself.\n","\n","As PyTorch automatically computes the gradients, that's all we need to do!
